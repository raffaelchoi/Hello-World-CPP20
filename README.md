# Hello World in C++20

This repository contains a hilariously overcomplicated program to print "Hello, World" in C++, utilizing numerous C++20 features. It serves as a fun and educational demonstration of some of the new additions to C++ as of the C++20 standard.

## Features Demonstrated

Here are some of the C++20 features you'll see in action in this code:

### Modules
The code uses modules to organize and encapsulate different parts of the program. Modules provide a more efficient and structured way to manage dependencies and improve code organization.

### Coroutines
Coroutines are used to simplify asynchronous programming. The program utilizes coroutines to print the message "Hello, World" asynchronously, demonstrating how coroutines make asynchronous code more readable and easier to understand.

### Concepts
Concepts are a powerful feature in C++20 that allow for better compile-time type checking and enable more expressive and readable generic code. The code utilizes concepts to ensure that the printable objects meet the required criteria for printing.

### The Three-Way Comparison Operator
C++20 introduces the three-way comparison operator (`<=>`), which provides a more concise way to compare objects. The program demonstrates the usage of the three-way comparison operator to compare objects and make decisions based on the comparison result.

### Ranges
Ranges are a new way to work with sequences of data in C++20. The code showcases the use of ranges to transform the "Hello, World" message into a vector of characters, providing a more intuitive and expressive way to process collections of data.

### std::format
C++20 introduces the `std::format` function, which provides a safer and more powerful way to format strings. The program demonstrates the usage of `std::format` to format the "Hello, World" message before printing it.

### Other Language and Library Features
In addition to the above features, the code also makes use of various other smaller language and library features introduced in C++20. These features contribute to enhancing the code's readability, performance, and overall programming experience.
